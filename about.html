        Adhering to Covid norms with Artificial Intelligence (MC02)</h2>
      <p class="about-para p-4">
        1. Monitoring Social Distancing
        With COVID-19 spreading universally, it is prominent to maintain social distancing while travelling
        in public places. Here image processing can be a game-changer. By taking input from CCTV
        Cameras and analyzing one frame at a time we will achieve the task at hand.
        
        Firstly, we use morphological operations and detection techniques to detect pedestrians in a
        frame. Next, we draw a bounding box surrounding each pedestrian. After which, we calculate the
        distance of one bounding box enclosing a pedestrian to its adjacent bounding boxes. Next, we
        decide a threshold for the distance between the bounding boxes and then based on their distance
        we categorize the pedestrians in the frame as red, yellow, or green.
        The red bounding box would mean people in the frame are very close together and therefore at
        maximum risk. The yellow box would mean that the people are at a considerable distance and the
        risk is medium. The green boxes would mean people are following the norms and they are safe.
        Integrating this system with an alerting mechanism (Loudspeakers)could be a great way to alert
        the pedestrians violating the COVID-19 norms!
        <br><br>
        2. Mask Detection
        Nowadays, wearing masks have been mandatory since the pandemic was discovered. As social
        distancing, mask detection is equally important to prevent any further surge in COVID cases. To
        detect mask. we need to first detect the human face. That can be achieved by identifying the
        facial landmarks such as eyes nose mouth etc. After detecting faces, we need to build an
        algorithm that can distinguish a face with a mask and a face without a mask.
        This calls for the need for a deep learning model. Training a deep learning model on datasets
        comprising of both mask and non-mask images. Once the model is trained it will be able to
        successfully identify mask and no-mask people. Using this, we can alert pedestrians to wear
        masks whenever they step out of their house.
